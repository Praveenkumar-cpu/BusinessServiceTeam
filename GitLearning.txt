Rebase
Rebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit.
Rebasing is most useful and easily visualized in the context of a feature branching workflow.
The primary reason for rebasing is to maintain a linear project history.
For example, consider a situation where the main branch has progressed since you started working on a feature branch.
You want to get the latest updates to the main branch in your feature branch, but you want to keep your branch's history clean
so, it appears as if you've been working off the latest main branch.
This gives the later benefit of a clean merge of your feature branch back into the main branch.
Why do we want to maintain a "clean history"?
The benefits of having a clean history become tangible when performing Git operations to investigate the introduction of a regression.
A more real-world scenario would be:
A bug is identified in the main branch.A feature that was working successfully is now broken.
A developer examines the history of the main branch using git log because of the "clean history" the developer is quickly able to reason about the history of the project.
