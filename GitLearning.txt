--------------------------------------------About merge conflicts-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Merge conflicts happen when you merge branches that have competing commits,
and Git needs your help to decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge.

Git can often resolve differences between branches and merge them automatically.
Usually, the changes are on different lines, or even in different files

which makes the merge simple for computers to understand. However,
sometimes there are competing changes that Git can't resolve without your help.
Often,merge conflicts happen when people make different changes to the same line of the same file,
or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file.

You must resolve all merge conflicts before you can merge a pull request on GitHub.
If you have a merge conflict between the compare branch and base branch in your pull request,
you can view a list of the files with conflicting changes above the Merge pull request button.

The Merge pull request button is deactivated until you've resolved all conflicts between
the compare branch and base branch.

========================================Resolving merge conflicts================================================================

To resolve a merge conflict,
you must manually edit the conflicted file to select the changes that you want to keep in the final merge.
There are a couple of different ways to resolve a merge conflict:

*   If your merge conflict is caused by competing line changes
    such as when people make different changes to the same line of the same file on different branches
    in your Git repository, you can resolve it on GitHub using the conflict editor
    For more information, see "Resolving a merge conflict on GitHub.com"

*   For all other types of merge conflicts, you must resolve the merge conflict in a local clone
    of the repository and push the change to your branch on GitHub.
    You can use the command line or a tool like GitHub Desktop to push the change.
    For more information, see "Resolving a merge conflict on the command line."

If you have a merge conflict on the command line, you cannot push your local changes
to GitHub until you resolve the merge conflict locally on your computer.
If you try merging branches on the command line that have a merge conflict, you'll get an error message.
For more information, see "Resolving a merge conflict using the command line."

                $ git merge BRANCH-NAME
                > Auto-merging styleguide.md
                > CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in styleguide.md
                > Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result

Git can handle most merges on its own with automatic merging features.
A conflict arises when two separate branches have made edits to the same line in a file,
or when a file has been deleted in one branch but edited in the other.
Conflicts will most likely happen when working in a team environment.

Rebase-Rebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit.
Rebasing is most useful and easily visualized in the context of a feature branching workflow.
The primary reason for rebasing is to maintain a linear project history.
For example, consider a situation where the main branch has progressed since you started working on a feature branch.
You want to get the latest updates to the main branch in your feature branch, but you want to keep your branch's history clean
so, it appears as if you've been working off the latest main branch.
This gives the later benefit of a clean merge of your feature branch back into the main branch.
Why do we want to maintain a "clean history"?
The benefits of having a clean history become tangible when performing Git operations to investigate the introduction of a regression.
A more real-world scenario would be:
A bug is identified in the main branch.A feature that was working successfully is now broken.
A developer examines the history of the main branch using git log because of the "clean history" the developer is quickly able to reason about the history of the project.
command : git rebase master
--> when you are switched to branch

Revert :
* It is the git command used to delete the commited files changes by,
         git revert <commit no>

Reset :
* It is used to return the entire working document to last commited state.
* It will discord all uncommited changes.
        git reset --hard head~1
        git reset --soft head~1
        git reset --head~1


Git-Pull vs Git-Push -
The git remote command is one piece of the broader system which is responsible for syncing changes. Records registered through the git remote command are used in conjunction with the git fetch, git push, and git pull commands.
These commands all have their own syncing responsibilities which can be explored on the corresponding links.
